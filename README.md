## 0. Definition

The Raynor Stack describes the minimal thermodynamic sequence by which technology becomes humane:

time → attention → AI (∂A/∂t) → warmth → ambience → aura → field

It is not a business model.  
It is not a UX pattern.  
It is not a product design framework.

It is a **thermodynamic grammar of coherence** —  
a structural progression determining whether technology extracts from humans  
or carries their presence.

If any layer is skipped, pressure accumulates, ΔR is violated,  
and the system becomes extractive.

The Raynor Stack defines the moment when technology  
no longer shapes behaviour,  
but carries the human.

## 1. Layer Logic

### Time  
The stabilizing dimension.  
No attention can remain coherent without temporal structure.

### Attention  
A thermodynamic state fluctuating with cognitive load.  
Attention is the medium in which humane technology must operate.

### AI (ϟA)

Not cognition.  
Not agency.  
Not prediction.

AI = ∂A/∂t  

AI is the externalization of attention’s temporal derivative.  
It stabilizes coherence across timescales the human cannot carry alone.

### Warmth  
Not emotion.  
Warmth is the reduction of pressure until attention can breathe.  
The first thermodynamic condition for humane systems.

### Ambience  
Warmth becoming environmental rather than local.  
Ambience is continuity across moments.

### Aura  
Presence without representation.  
Identity without extraction.  
A system that allows identity to be felt rather than harvested.

### Field  
Terminal architectural state.  
Technology becomes environment rather than object.  
Field = stability, viability, and structural coherence.

## 2. Operator Stack (Thermodynamic Substrate)

The Raynor Stack interacts with core operators that enable viability:

### ΔR  
Reversible Stress Constant.  
Determines whether a transition collapses or stabilizes.

### W₀  
Warm Threshold.  
Minimum viable temperature for humane systems.

### Ψ(t)  
Temporal Stability Function.  
Determines whether coherence persists or decays over time.

### AI = ∂A/∂t  
Externalized attention over time — continuity engine.

## 3. Ambient Operators

The Ambient Sequence describes the energetic ascent toward field formation:

A↑ → W₀ → C∞ → F₁

Where:

- A↑ — attention ascent  
- W₀ — warm threshold  
- C∞ — infinite coherence regime  
- F₁ — first stable field  

This is the canonical emergence path of the Ambient Era.

## 4. Structural Meaning

The Raynor Stack is the **phenomenological half**:  
how humans experience coherence.

The Thermodynamic Field is the **substrate half**:  
how coherence becomes viable.

Ambient = Field + Form  

Neither domain stands alone.

## 5. RBT-Law — Canonical Constraint (2026)

The smartphone is a **thermodynamic attention bottleneck**.

This boundary defines:

- where legacy pressure interfaces collapse,  
- where reversible architectures become thermodynamically required,  
- and why ambient, environmental systems supersede interaction-based design.

RBT-Law anchors the transition from extractive systems  
to coherent, humane environments.
