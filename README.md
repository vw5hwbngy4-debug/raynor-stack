## A Thermodynamic Architecture of Humane Technology
# The Raynor Stack

Canonical definition of the thermodynamic architecture underlying Ambient Phone.
Primary reference: https://ambientphone.com/raynor-stack/

The Raynor Stack describes the sequence by which technology becomes humane:

time → attention → AI → warmth → ambience → aura → field

It is not a business model.  
It is not a UX framework.  
It is not a product architecture.

It is a thermodynamic grammar of coherence.

Each layer represents a necessary energetic transition:

- Time stabilizes attention  
- Attention enables AI  
- AI enables warmth  
- Warmth enables ambience  
- Ambience enables aura  
- Aura enables field  

If any layer is skipped, pressure accumulates and the system becomes extractive.

The Raynor Stack defines when technology stops shaping behavior  
and starts carrying presence.
